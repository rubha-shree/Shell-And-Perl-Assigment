# Shell-And-Perl-Assigment

1. Write a shell script to identify all the files in a given path that start with a given alphabet.
It should accept as an argument the base path in which to locate the files.
The alphabet that needs to be treated as the starting character.
All the corner cases (like, no directory found, or invalid input for alphabet) should be handled.
It should generate proper messages to the user.

2. Write an interactive perl script for simulating a STACK. A user should be allowed to push, pop from the stack. The interactive session should run till the user enters quit. At the end of the session it should print the final state of the STACK.
Example:
Enter next command : pop
No elements
Enter next command : push 1
Done
Enter next command : push 2
Done
Enter next command : push 3
Done
Enter next command : pop
popped 3
Enter next command : push 4
Done
Enter next command : quit
Final state : [4, 2, 1]
